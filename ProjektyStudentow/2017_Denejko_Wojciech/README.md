TodoREST
========

This sample demonstrates a Todo list application where the data is stored and accessed from a RESTful web service. The web service is hosted by Azure webservice which is currently offline. Therefore, the operations that create, update, and delete data will not alter the data consumed in the application. However, a hostable version of the REST service that provides read-write access to the data is stored in the *TodoRESTService* folder.
